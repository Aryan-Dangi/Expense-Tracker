Visual Studio Code was selected as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project due to its flexibility, performance, and strong support for Python development. VS Code provides key features like syntax highlighting, code suggestions, integrated debugging, and Git version control, which significantly streamlined the development process. Its wide range of extensions, including those for Python and Tkinter, helped enhance productivity and make the coding experience more efficient. Additionally, VS Code’s user-friendly interface and customization options contributed to a pleasant development workflow.

3.5	Git and GitHub:
Git and GitHub were used for version control and project collaboration. Git allowed for the efficient tracking of changes in the codebase, enabling the team to revert to earlier versions if necessary and maintain an organized development process. GitHub served as the repository for the project, making it easier to collaborate with team members and share code remotely. It also provided version tracking, issue management, and a platform for seamless teamwork, ensuring that all team members were aligned and could contribute to the development process effectively.

4.	Project Design
The Expense Tracker Application is designed to manage hostel expenses effectively, allowing users to input, categorize, and view their daily expenditures. The application is built in a modular structure, with distinct components responsible for various tasks like handling data input, displaying the user interface, managing the database, and generating reports. The following section outlines the main components, classes, and functions, along with their interactions that help achieve the project’s objectives.
4.1	 Core Components and Classes

4.1.1	Main Application Class: 
The Application class acts as the starting point of the Expense Tracker application. It initializes the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and handles the overall flow of the application. The class is responsible for creating the main window, managing window transitions, and handling user inputs.

Key Functions:
•	Initialize the main window and create widgets (buttons, labels, etc.).
•	Control transitions between different windows (e.g., Add Expense, View Expenses).
•	Handle user inputs and pass data to other components (e.g., submitting expenses).

4.1.2	Expense Management (Expense Class):
The Expense class is the core of the application. It handles all operations related to expense tracking, such as adding, editing, and deleting expenses. It also manages expense attributes like amount, category, and date.

Key Functions:
•	add_expense(): Adds a new expense to the system.
•	edit_expense(): Updates an existing expense.
•	delete_expense(): Removes an expense.
•	view_expenses(): Fetches all expenses for display.
•	filter_expenses(): Filters expenses by category or date for better reporting.

4.1.3	Database Management (Database Class):
The Database class is responsible for managing all database-related operations using SQLite. It ensures persistent storage for all expense data, allowing it to be retrieved or modified when needed. This abstraction helps maintain modularity in the application.

Key Functions:
•	connect_db(): Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
•	create_table(): Creates necessary tables in the database if they don't exist.
•	execute_query(): Executes SQL queries (INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE) to interact with the database.
•	fetch_all(): Retrieves all records from the database.

4.1.4	User Interface (UI Class):
The UI class manages the visual layout and interactive elements of the application. Built with Tkinter, it creates buttons, text fields, labels, and displays. The class is responsible for capturing user input and displaying data in a user-friendly manner.

Key Functions:
•	create_widgets(): Creates and arranges the GUI components (buttons, labels, etc.).
•	display_expenses(): Displays the list of expenses in a structured table.
•	update_ui(): Updates the UI when user actions are made, like adding or editing an expense.

4.1.5	Validation and Error Handling (Validator Class):
The Validator class ensures that the data entered by the user is valid. It checks for proper formats (e.g., numeric values for amounts) and ensures that fields are filled correctly. This class helps minimize errors and enhances the application's reliability.

Key Functions:
•	validate_amount(): Ensures the entered amount is a valid number.
•	validate_date(): Checks that the date is in the correct format.
•	validate_category(): Verifies that the selected category is valid.


4.2	 Interaction Between Components
The components of the Expense Tracker Application interact seamlessly to achieve the desired functionality:
•	User Interface (UI): Users interact with the application through the GUI, entering expense details and navigating between different windows. When a user adds an expense, the UI passes the data to the Expense class for processing

•	Expense Management: The Expense class takes the entered data and interacts with the Database class to store the data. If any input is invalid, the Validator class validates it and provides feedback to the user.


•	Database Management: The Database class executes SQL queries to save or retrieve data from the SQLite database, ensuring that all data is stored persistently.

•	Displaying Data: When the user wants to view their expenses, the UI class fetches data from the Expense class and presents it in a well-organized table format.


•	Navigation: The App class orchestrates the navigation between different screens (such as adding, viewing, and editing expenses), providing a smooth user experience.

4.3	 Achieving Project Objectives
This design ensures the application meets its objectives:

•	Efficient Data Management: The combination of the Expense and Database classes enables efficient storage and retrieval of data.

•	User-Friendly Interface: The UI class ensures that the application is easy to use and visually appealing, allowing users to navigate the system with ease.


•	Robust Validation: The Validator class ensures that all user inputs are correct and avoids errors in the application.

•	Scalability: By organizing the application into distinct classes, the design is flexible and can easily be expanded to include new features like advanced reporting, multi-user support, or more detailed analytics.
